<h3>Why Rust?</h3>

<p>Rust is a language that is both highly expressive and blazingly fast. Here are some of the reasons why we choose to use it:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Super fast, as in C and C++ fast.
	<li>A standard package manager that makes it very easy to handle dependencies and share your own projects in seconds.
	<li>Highly portable. Easily build for MacOS, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS and so many others.
	No header files (and no weird linking errors).
	<li>Sum Types and Pattern Matching (and no NULL).
	Local type inference. Only write types where it matters, no need to repeat yourself.
	<li>A more modern, ƒunctional and expressive style.
	<li>Memory safe and data-race-free! Get your ideas down without the fear of creating pointer spaghetti or segfault time-sinks.
	<li>Module system resulting in very clean and concise name spaces.
	<li>One of the kindest internet communities we've come across (please visit mozilla's #rust or /r/rust if you're starting out and need any pointers)
</ul>
